# ES6 Modules üéÅüéÅ

## Your first javascript code in terminal.

### [I have written a blog post about es6 modules](https://ahmadrazakhan946.hashnode.dev/your-first-javascript-code-in-terminal).

#### You can attempt this challenge if you know what a `es6 module` is.

## Here is the challenge

### do
```shell
npm init -y
```

### and make four files
* `index.js`
* `continents.js`
* `countries.js`
* `helpers.js` ( for helper functions )

<br/>

### in `continents.js` make an array of objects called `continents` with the following properties:
* `id`
* `name`
* `countries` an array of country object's id
### and export this array of objects.
<br/>

### in `countries.js` make an array of objects called `countries` with the following properties:
* `id`
* `name`
* `continentId`
### and export this array of objects.

<br/>

### take this map
```js
const map = {
    "Asia": {
        show: true,
    },
    "Africa": {
        show: true,
    },
    "Europe": {
        show: false,
    },
};
```

### and make a function called `getCountries` in `helpers.js`  that takes a continent name and returns an array of country objects that belong to that continent.
