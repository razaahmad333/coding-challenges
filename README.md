### Here is few steps to follow

- ### Fork the repo

  - At the top right corner of the page, click on the `Fork` button

  - After forking, you will be redirected to a screen of creating a new repo with a `Create Fork` button.

  - Click on the `Create Fork` button.

- ### Clone the repo

  - After creating the repo, find and click on the `Clone` button.

  - Copy the link by clicking on the copy icon.

- ### Open your favorite terminal and run the following command

  ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/coding-challenges.git
  ```

  or

  ```shell
    git clone  git@github.com:<your_github_username>/coding-challenges.git
  ```

- ### Now open up your favourite text editor and Add your solution

  - Open the folder `coding-challenges`

  - Go to the question folder for the prblem you want to solve

    For example:

    problem: `2022-06-26-Format_Descriptor`

    question folder would be: `coding-challenges/2022-06-26-Format_Descriptor`

  - You will find out a Solutions folder inside that.

    For example: `coding-challenges/2022-06-26-Format_Descriptor/Solutions`

  - In this folder, create a new folder by your name

    For example: `coding-challenges/2022-06-26-Format_Descriptor/Solutions/YOUR_NAME`

  (you will see a folder named `Ahmad_Raza` already there, that's solution by me)

  - Here create any file you want, for your solution.
    with any extension (.js .py .cpp .txt etc)

  - after adding your solution, commit it to your repo

- ### How Should I Commit?

  open up a terminal and start type following commands

  - add all the files you have added to your repo

  ```shell
      git add .
  ```

  - commit

  ```shell
      git commit -m "i added my solution or any nice message you like"
  ```

  - push the code to your repo

  ```shell
      git push origin main
  ```

- ### Now its time for pull request.

  - Go to your repo on GitHub and click on the `Pull Requests` button.

  - Click on the `New pull request` button.

  - Click on the `Create Pull Request` button.

  - Now write a short description of what you have done or leave it empty.

  - Find and Click on the ` Create pull request` button on that page.
