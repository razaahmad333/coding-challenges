### Here is few steps to follow

- ### Fork the repo

  At the top right corner of the page, click on the `Fork` button

  After forking, you will be redirected to a screen of creating a new repo with a `Create Fork` button.

- ### Clone the repo

  After creating the repo, find and click on the `Clone` button.

  Copy the link by clicking on the copy icon.

- ### Open your favorite terminal and run the following command

  ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/coding-challenges.git
  ```

  or

  ```shell
      git clone  git@github.com:<your_github_username>/coding-challenges.git
  ```

- ### Now open up your favourite text editor and Add your solution

Open the folder `coding-challenges`

Go to the question folder for the prblem you want to solve

For example:
problem: `2022-06-26-Format_Descriptor`
question folder would be: `coding-challenges/2022-06-26-Format_Descriptor`

You will find out a Solutions folder inside that.

For example: `coding-challenges/2022-06-26-Format_Descriptor/Solutions`

In this folder, create a new folder by your name

For example: `coding-challenges/2022-06-26-Format_Descriptor/Solutions/YOUR_NAME`

(you will see a folder named `Ahmad_Raza` already there, that's solution by me)

Here create any file you want, for your solution.
with any extension (.js .py .cpp .txt etc)

after adding your solution, commit it to your repo

- ### How Should I Commit?

open up a terminal and start type following commands

- create a new branch

```shell
    git checkout -b YOUR_BRANCH_NAME
```

- add all the files you have added to your repo

```shell
    git add .
```

- commit

```shell
    git commit -m "i added my solution or any nice message you like"
```

- push the code to your repo

```shell
    git push main YOUR_BRANCH_NAME
```
